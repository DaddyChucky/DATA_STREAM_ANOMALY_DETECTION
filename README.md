# DATA_STREAM_ANOMALY_DETECTION

## Overview
This project involves developing a Python script to detect anomalies in a continuous data stream of floating-point numbers, simulating real-time sequences such as financial transactions or system metrics. The goal is to identify unusual patterns, including exceptionally high values or deviations from normal behavior, while adapting to concept drift and seasonal variations.

## Choice of Algorithm: Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing
**[Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-thorough-introduction-to-holt-winters-forecasting-c21810b8c0e6)** is selected for this project due to its effectiveness in handling both trend and seasonality in time series data. It decomposes the data into level, trend, and seasonal components, allowing the model to adapt to changes over time (concept drift) and seasonal patterns. By forecasting expected values and comparing them with actual data points, the algorithm can identify anomalies based on significant deviations from the forecasted values.

### Explanation
This choice of algorithm is effective, since it is **(1) highly adaptable**, **(2) handles seasonal variations efficiently**, and is **(3) capable of handling live data**.
- **(1)** It adjusts to changes in the underlying data patterns, making it suitable for streaming data with concept drift.
- **(2)** Efficiently models seasonal variations, ensuring that regular periodic fluctuations are not falsely flagged as anomalies.
- **(3)** Capable of updating forecasts incrementally as new data arrives, which is essential for real-time anomaly detection.

## Implementation Specifics
- **Data Stream Simulation**: A generator function simulates a real-time data stream, incorporating trend, seasonality, and random noise.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing to forecast expected values and flags data points that deviate significantly from these forecasts.
- **Visualization**: Real-time plotting of the data stream with highlighted anomalies using matplotlib.
- **Optimization**: Efficient computation ensures the script runs smoothly in real-time.
- **Error Handling & Validation**: Robust mechanisms to handle unexpected data and ensure data integrity.

## External Libraries
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For real-time visualization.
